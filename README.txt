This is discord bot made with node.js with the purpose of giving quests to players on my minecraft server. 
To run the bot there are a couple options:
1. go to my minecraft discord server and see the bot in progress
2. add the bot to your own discord server and run it. 

for option 1 enter the following link into your browser, log in, and go the the "quests" channel: https://discord.gg/eE5mXkc

for option 2 you will need to follow the discord guide on how to add a bot to your server, install node, and run index.js with node.

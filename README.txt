Hey there! For safety reasons the token and channel id in config has been changed to "none". If you want to use this bot for your own server
you will need to create a bot account and edit those variables. Thanks!

This is discord bot made with node.js with the purpose of giving quests to players on my minecraft server. 
To run the bot add the bot to your own discord server and run it. 

You will need to follow the discord guide on how to add a bot to your server, install node, and run index.js with node.
